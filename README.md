FINAL PROJECT- Creating a Crowd Calendar Predictor for Tokyo Disney Resort Parks

PROPOSAL
We all want to maximise our fun when in a theme park and limit time lining up. What if you could consult a calendar to know the best time to visit before you even leave home? Currently this information is only available to Japanese Disney fans so I will endeavour to make an English version using machine learning and data scraped from the Japanese Crowd Calendar, as well as Time and Date and Accuweather.
